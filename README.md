# ABrowser
Just a browser I decided to make quite a while ago now.

## Installation
On macOS, just download the AMacBrowserApp binary. It will say it is insecure, but it isn't. If you don't trust me, build from source.
On iOS, you will have to:
* Enable developer mode
* Open the Xcode Project
* Either build from source and add that binary or add the prebuilt binary

## Support
AMacBrowser requires macOS Sonoma (14.0) or later.
AnIPhoneBrowser requires iOS 17.0 or later.
